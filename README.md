# Word-Guess-Game


    This project is a Star Wars based quiz working with the themes of Lightside & Darkside Characters and Tiltles.

    You can brush up on your star wars knowledge by working through the quiz a few times until you can recognise the answers
    just by seeing how many letter spaces there are.

    To start the project all you have to do is click on the first letter you want to use and you're away!

    I hope you have fun!
